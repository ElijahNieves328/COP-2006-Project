# COP-2006-Project
This is a simple guessing game made as a project for my COP 2006 class. 
The game asks for user info, stores it, and then plays the game.
It will pick a random number between 1 and 15. The user gets ten tries. Each attempt, the game tells you whether you are above or below the chosen number.
Once the game is finished, it will record your high score and ask if you would like to play again.
The game shows all high scores when you begin the game.
When you are done playing, the game will tell you your best score from all the games you played that session, and your total score.
